## How to use:
Run the code like: `python3 main.py`

## About Project:
This is the code for the implementation of a hybrid encryption algorithm (symmetric + asymmetric).  
The program first encrypts the data with **AES symmetric** encryption algorithm.  
It then encrypts the AES encrypted data with **RSA asymmetric** encryption algorithm.  
The final output is then displayed.
